An amalgam of workbook and manifesto, featuring a collection of interleaved statements, diagrammatic scores, and instructional texts, Structure and Synthesis is a direct engagement with Fell's original thinking and his continual provocations in regard to "experimental" music. Alongside reflections on theory and practice, the volume includes exercises for dismantling musical expertise, habits, and intuitions, documenting Fell's explorations of the peripheries of rhythm, shape, and time in perception and performance. Long-term collaborator designer Joe Gilmore provides a striking graphic context for Fell's evolving thinking and the methods and structures he has developed through his solo and collaborative work. 0aElectronic music. 0aAvant-garde (Music) 0aElectronica (Music) 6aÉlectronica (Musique)0(CaQQLa)000268631 6aMusique expérimentale.0(CaQQLa)201-0207975 7aAvant-garde (Music)2fast0(OCoLC)fst00824287 7aElectronica (Music)2fast0(OCoLC)fst017652561 aMackay, Robinc(Philosopher)eeditor.1 aGilmore, Joe,d1968-edesigner.40uhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7JuwrEI_5I1_ynOQ_0H4vqSXtD-4gePdyAn accompanying playlist is available on our YouTube channel, featuring tracks mentioned and discussed in the book.0 822978729560002122bMUSICcstkhML1380i.F45 2021
